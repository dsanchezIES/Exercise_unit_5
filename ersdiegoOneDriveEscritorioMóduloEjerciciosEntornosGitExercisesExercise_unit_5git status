[32m+[m[32mIn the world of the animals, there was a very arrogantÂ hareÂ because she said to everyone she was theÂ fastest. Thatâ€™s why she was always laughing at theÂ slow turtle.[m
[32m+[m[32m-Look at the turtle! HeyÂ turtle, donâ€™t run so much that youâ€™re going to get tired of going so fast!- The hare used to say laughing at the turtle.[m
[32m+[m[32mOne day, they were talking and it occurred to the turtle to make a strangeÂ betÂ with the hare.[m
[32m+[m[32m-Iâ€™m sure I can win you a race- she said.[m
[32m+[m[32m- To me?- asked the hare astonished.[m
[32m+[m[32m-Yes, to you. Letâ€™s put our bet on that stone and letâ€™s see who wins the race.[m
[32m+[m[32mThe hare, very amused, accepted. All theÂ animalsÂ met to watch the race. The road and the finishing line were marked. Once it was ready, the race started among big applauses.[m
[32m+[m[32mRelying on her speed, the hare left the turtle go and she remained lazing about. She had time enough to win such a slow creature![m
[32m+[m[32mThen she start running, she run fast as the wind while the turtle went slow but without stopping. At once she went ahead. She stopped next to the road and she sat to rest.[m
[32m+[m[32mWhen the turtle passed by her side, the hare made fun of her once more. She left her advantage and set out her quick walk. She did the same several times but, in spite of her mocks, the turtle kept her way until she arrived to the finishing line. When the hare woke up, she ran with all her might but it was too late, the turtle hadÂ wonÂ the race.[m
[32m+[m[32mThat day was very sad for the hare and she learnt a lesson she would never forget: you must never mock of the others.[m

[32m+[m[32mOnce upon a time, a king and a queen had a baby daughter, and when she saw her black hair, snowy white skin and red red lips she decided to call her Snow White. Snow White grew up to be a pretty child, but sadly, after a few years, her mother died and her father married again. The new queen, Snow White's stepmother, was a beautiful woman too, but she was very vain. More than anything else she wanted to be certain that she was the most beautiful woman in the world.[m
[32m+[m[32mShe had a magic mirror, and she used to look at herself in it each clay and say:[m
[32m+[m[32m- Mirror, mirror on the wall, Who is the fairest one of all?[m
[32m+[m[32mAnd the mirror would always reply:[m
[32m+[m[32m- You, oh Queen, are the fairest one of all.[m
[32m+[m[32mThe queen would smile when she heard this for she knew the mirror never failed to speak the truth. The years passed. Each year Snow White grew prettier and prettier, until one day, her stepmother looked in the magic mirror and said:[m
[32m+[m[32m- Mirror, mirror on the wall, Who is the fairest one of all?[m
[32m+[m[32m- You, oh Queen, are fair, but Snow White is fairer than you now.[m
[32m+[m[32mThe queen was angry and jealous. In a terrible rage she decided that Snow White should be killed. She called for a hunter and told him to take Snow White far into the forest and to kill her there. In order to prove that Snow White was indeed dead, she commanded him to cut out Snow White's heart and bring it back to her.[m
[32m+[m[32mThe hunter was very sad, because he loved Snow White very much, but he knew he must obey his orders. He took her deep into the forest and, as he drew his knife, but he couldn't kill her. He told her never to come back to the castle, then he killed a young deer and cut out its heart and took this to the queen, pretending it was Snow White's heart.[m
[32m+[m[32mPoor Snow White was tired, lonely and hungry in the forest. She wandered through the trees, until she came to a clearing and found a little house. She opened it and went inside. There she saw a room with a long table laid with seven places with food, and she ate a little from each one. Beyond the table were seven little beds. She tried out some of them, and when she found one that was comfortable, she fell into a deep sleep, for she was exhausted by her long journey through the forest.[m
[32m+[m[32mThe cottage was the home of seven dwarfs. All day long they worked in a nearby mine digging diamonds from deep inside the mountain. When they returned home that evening, they were amazed to see that someone had been into their cottage and had taken some food and drink from each place at their table. They were also surprised to find their beds disturbed, until one dwarf called out that he had found a lovely girl asleep on his bed.[m
[32m+[m[32mThe next morning Snow White awoke and met the dwarfs, and she told them her story. When she explained how she now had no home, the dwarfs immediately asked her whether she would like to stay with them.[m
[32m+[m[32mBack at the palace the queen welcomed the hunter when he returned with the deer's heart. She was happy that now she was once more the most beautiful woman in the world. As soon as she was alone, she looked n her magic mirror and said, confidently:[m
[32m+[m[32m- Mirror, mirror on the wall, Who is the fairest one of all?[m
[32m+[m[32mTo her horror, the mirror replied:[m
[32m+[m[32m- You, oh Queen, are fair, it's true, but Snow White is fairer still than you.[m
[32m+[m[32mThe queen trembled with anger as she realized that the hunter had tricked her. She decided that she would now find Snow White and kill her herself. The queen disguised herself as an old pedlar woman with a basket of apples, and one of them was poisoned. Â When she knocked at the cottage door, the queen offered Snow White an apple as a present. Snow White stretched out her hand for the apple and also took a bite. At once Snow White was affected by the poison and fell down as though dead.[m
[32m+[m[32mThat evening when the dwarfs returned they were quite unable to revive her. They watched over her through the night, but when morning came she still lay without any sign of life, and they decided she must be dead. Weeping bitterly, they laid herein a coffin and placed a glass lid over the top so that all could admire her beauty, even though she was dead. Then they carried the coffin to the top of a hill where they took turns to stand guard.[m
[32m+[m[32mNot long after this a prince came riding through the forest and came to the hill where Snow White lay in her glass-topped coffin. She looked so beautiful that he loved her at once and he asked the dwarfs if he could kiss her. As the prince kissed Snow White gently, he moved her head. The piece of poisoned apple fell from her lips. Slowly she came back to life. Snow White saw the handsome prince kneeling on the ground beside her, and fell in love with him straight away.[m
[32m+[m[32mThen the queen far away in the palace heard from the mirror:[m
[32m+[m[32m- You, oh Queen, are fair, its true, But Snow White is fairer still than you.[m
[32m+[m[32mShe was furious that Snow White had escaped death once more. And now the king discovered what mischief she had been up to, and banished her from his land. No one ever saw her or her mirror again. As for Snow White, she said farewell to her kind friends the dwarfs, and rode away on the back of the prince's horse. At his castle they were married and they both lived happily forever afterwards.[m
[32m+[m[32mThis is the end.[m[41m [m
